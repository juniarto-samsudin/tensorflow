The MinMaxScaler is the probably the most famous scaling algorithm, and follows formula fore each feature:
      (xi - min(x)) / ( max(x) - min(x))
It is essentially shrinks the range such that the range is now between 0 and 1 ( or -1 to 1 if there are negative values).
This scaler works better for cases in which the standard scaler might not work so well. If the destribution is not Gaussian or 
the standard deviation is very small, the min-max scaler works better.

However , it is sensitive to outliers, so if there are outliers in the data, you might want to consider the ROBUST SCALER.

Example:
